Dr. Khac-Hoang Ngo received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in electronics and telecommunications from [University of Engineering and Technology](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/), Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2014; and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) and Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), Paris-Saclay University, France, in 2016 and 2020, respectively. His Ph.D. thesis was also realized at Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Laboratory, Paris Research Center, Huawei Technologies France. 

Since September 2020, he has been working as a postdoctoral researcher at [Communication Systems Group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/Communication-systems/Pages/Communication-Systems.aspx), Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. He is also an adjunct lecturer at University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University Hanoi, Vietnam. His research interests include wireless communications and information theory, with an emphasis on massive random access, edge computing, MIMO, noncoherent communications, coded caching, and network coding. He received the [Honda Award for Young Engineers and Scientists (Honda Y-E-S Award)](https://www.hondafoundation.jp/yes/index_en/119) in Vietnam in 2013, the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Individual Fellowship](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101022113) in 2021, and the "[Signal, Image & Vision Ph.D. Thesis Prize](http://gretsi.fr/prix-de-these2021/resultats.php)" by Club EEA, GRETSI and GdR-ISIS, France in 2021.
