**The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions in Horizon 2020**

The [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA)](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions) is part of the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 research funding scheme and aims to support the career development and training of researchers – with a focus on innovation skills – in all scientific disciplines through international and intersectoral mobility.

In particular, the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships (IF)](https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_MSCA-IF-2020) aim to enhance the creative and innovative potential of experienced researchers, wishing to diversify their individual competence in terms of skill acquisition through advanced training, international and intersectoral mobility. Individual Fellowships provide opportunities to acquire and transfer new knowledge and to work on research and innovation in a European context (EU Member States and Associated Countries) or outside Europe. They develop the careers of individual researchers who show great potential, considering their experience, and include a specific opportunity for those returning to the profession.

Fellowships take the form of European Fellowships or Global Fellowships. 

* European Fellowships are held in EU Member States or Horizon 2020 Associated Countries and are open to researchers either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe.
* Global Fellowships are based on a secondment to a third country and a mandatory 12 month return period to a European host. 

My MSCA is a standard European Fellowships. “LANTERN” (Grant agreement ID: 101022113).
