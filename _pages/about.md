# Bio

I received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in electronics and telecommunications from [University of Engineering and Technology](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/), Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2014; and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) and Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), Paris-Saclay University, France, in 2016 and 2020, respectively. My Ph.D. thesis was also realized at the Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Laboratory, Paris Research Center, Huawei Technologies France. Since September 2024, I have been an assistant professor at the [Division of Communication Systems](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/isy/ks), [Linköping University](https://liu.se/en). From September 2020 to August 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Communication Systems Group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/Communication-systems/Pages/Communication-Systems.aspx), Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. My research interests include wireless communications, information theory, and machine learning, with an emphasis on massive random access, AI privacy and security, information freshness, MIMO, and noncoherent communications. 

<!--- I received the [Honda Award for Young Engineers and Scientists (Honda Y-E-S Award)](https://www.hondafoundation.jp/yes/index_en/119) in Vietnam in 2013, the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Individual Fellowship](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101022113) in 2021, and the "[Signal, Image & Vision Ph.D. Thesis Prize](http://gretsi.fr/prix-de-these2021/resultats.php)" by Club EEA, GRETSI and GdR-ISIS, France in 2021. -->

# News
* 11/2025: **I am recruiting a PhD student to work on AI Security with a focus on memory poisoning in LLM Agents for the VR project below. Read full information and apply here: [https://liu.se/en/work-at-liu/vacancies/27883](https://liu.se/en/work-at-liu/vacancies/27883)**
* 10/2025: I am granted funding (6 MSEK) from the Swedish Research Council (VR) for the project "Memory Poisoning in LLM Agents: Foundations, Attacks, and Defenses". My co-PIs are Alexandre Graell i Amat (Chalmers) and Johan Östman (Recorded Future). We will soon recruit a PhD student for this project.
* 10/2025: I presented a tutorial on ``Unsourced Multiple Access: from Support Recovery to Type Estimation'' at the [Swedish Communication Technologies Workshop (Swe-CTW)](https://site.ieee.org/swe-ctw/tutorials/). Type-based unsourced multiple access (TUMA) (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19552), [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19954), and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19916)) is a framework in which multiple devices track the state of physical/digital processes, quantize this state, and communicate it to a common receiver through a shared channel in an uncoordinated manner. The reported type serves as an interface for downstream inference tasks.
* 10/2025: My first two PhD students at Linköping University, namely, Sipeng Liu and Garima Bazard, started their PhD on point cloud transmission for remote registration, both funded by WASP.
* 09/2025: Our paper ["Practical Bayes-Optimal Membership Inference Attacks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24089) is accepted to NeurIPS 2025.
* 08/2025: Two papers accepted by IEEE GLOBECOM 2025: ["Information Age and Correctness for Energy Harvesting Devices with Random Access"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14522) and ["Breaking the TDD Flow for Over-the-Air Phase
Synchronization in Distributed Antenna Systems"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11411)
* 11/2024: I received the 2024 **Golden Globe Science and Technology Award** in Vietnam. The Vietnam Ministry of Science and Technology and the Vietnam Youth Union present this annual award to ten selected under-35 Vietnamese scientists.
* 09/2024: **I joined Linköping University as an assistant professor.**
<!--- * 05/2024: Our paper [Secure Aggregation is Not Private Against Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17775) is accepted to the European Conference on Machine Learning.
* 04/2024: I visited Prof. Petar Popovski at Aalborg University, Denmark. Lots of fruitful discussion!
